This package includes the code for calculating the SSIMs for the images taken by the ZED camera and Intel RealSense camera and their ground truth images. A detailed explanation of the code is described in the Jupyter Notebook in the "notebooks" folder.

Instruction: The command python run.py test will automatically generate the SSIM results for the five filters, and write them on the text file inside "results".

Here is a Google Drive link to all of the images that our team has collected:
